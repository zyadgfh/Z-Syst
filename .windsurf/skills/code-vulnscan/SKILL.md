# Code-VulnScan — Deep Codebase Vulnerability Scanner

This skill performs comprehensive, flow-aware security analysis on any codebase. It combines taint tracking, control-flow analysis, business logic review, API security auditing, secret detection, configuration review, and dependency auditing to find real, exploitable vulnerabilities — not keyword matches.

- Use the IDE's own tools for reading, searching, and reasoning about code.
- Use local Python scripts for deterministic file enumeration, AST-based analysis, secret entropy scanning, dependency checking, state tracking, and report generation.
- Do not call external LLM-provider APIs as part of this skill.
- Every confirmed finding requires a verified evidence chain. Candidates without verification are never reported.

## Command surface

- `vulnscan scan <path> [--lang python,javascript,...] [--severity critical,high,medium,low] [--exclude vendor,tests]`
- `vulnscan taint <file> [--lang <language>]`
- `vulnscan secrets <path>`
- `vulnscan deps <path>`
- `vulnscan config <path>`
- `vulnscan report [--run-id <id>] [--format markdown|json|sarif] [--min-severity medium]`
- `vulnscan status`
- `vulnscan commit <hash> [--repo <path>] [--base <base-hash>] [--severity critical,high,medium,low]`
- `vulnscan diff <base> <head> [--repo <path>] [--severity critical,high,medium,low]`
- `vulnscan pr <pr-number> [--repo <path>] [--severity critical,high,medium,low]`

**Commit/diff mode:** Scans only the files and code regions changed in a commit or between two refs. Faster than a full scan — designed for CI/CD pipelines and code review. Findings are tagged `introduced_in_diff: true` (new vulnerability in the changed code) or `introduced_in_diff: false` (pre-existing vulnerability in code called by the change). Use `vulnscan commit HEAD` to scan the most recent commit, `vulnscan diff main HEAD` to scan a feature branch, or `vulnscan pr 42` to scan a GitHub PR diff.

Defaults: report `critical`, `high`, `medium` findings. Auto-detect language from file extensions.

## Core architecture

- `sub-skills/` — cognitive instructions for each analysis phase (24 specialized agents)
- `scripts/` — deterministic Python helpers for enumeration, AST analysis, entropy scanning, dependency checking, report generation
- `resources/patterns/` — per-language source/sink/sanitizer pattern definitions
- `resources/references/` — CWE taxonomy, OWASP Top 10, false-positive guidance
- `workspace/` — SQLite scan state, intermediate JSON outputs, final reports

## The golden rule: evidence-based findings only

A confirmed finding requires **all three**:
1. A **source** — user-controlled data enters the system (or a dangerous condition exists).
2. A **sink / consequence** — a dangerous operation can be triggered.
3. A **path** — source reaches sink with no effective mitigation in between.

Pattern-match candidates are **never** confirmed findings. Every candidate passes through `sub-skills/false-positive-filter.md` before being reported.

## Full analysis workflow

### Phase 0: Strategy (always run first)

Read `sub-skills/scan-strategy.md` to produce a concrete scan plan:
- Detected languages, frameworks, entry points
- Prioritized file list
- Active vulnerability categories
- Fresh or resume decision
- Whether the scan needs React, Go, architecture, or application-vulnerability deep review

```bash
python3 scripts/scan.py --path <target> --status-only
```

If a recent incomplete run exists, ask whether to resume or start fresh.

```bash
python3 scripts/scan.py --path <target> [--lang python,javascript] [--exclude vendor,tests,node_modules]
```

This populates `workspace/scan_state.db` with candidate findings. Review the summary before proceeding.

---

### Phase 0A: Technology and architecture deep-review routing

Load these focused reviewers when the scan plan matches their trigger:

- `sub-skills/react-security-reviewer.md` — React, Next.js, Remix, React Router, JSX/TSX, browser tokens, client routing, postMessage, or hydration data.
- `sub-skills/go-security-reviewer.md` — Go `net/http`, Gin, Echo, Fiber, Chi, Gorilla, gRPC, workers, request binding, or Go server hardening.
- `sub-skills/architecture-security-reviewer.md` — multi-service systems, SaaS/tenant boundaries, workers/queues, plugins/connectors, cloud trust boundaries, service accounts.
- `sub-skills/application-vuln-reviewer.md` — IDOR/BOLA, CSRF, account recovery, mass assignment, file upload/download, session lifecycle, rate limits, billing/workflow abuse.
- `sub-skills/infrastructure-security-reviewer.md` — cloud IAM, network exposure, object storage, KMS/secrets, runtime platforms, CI/CD supply chain, audit/logging, backups.

These reviewers do not replace taint analysis. Use them to expand the entry-point list, identify non-obvious sources/sinks, and add manual review targets before Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1: Taint and injection analysis (parallel)

Read `sub-skills/taint-analyzer.md`. Run per-file taint analysis:

```bash
python3 scripts/taint.py --file <path> --lang <language>
```

Use script output as a starting map. **Read every flagged file directly** and trace each candidate path step by step. Verify every taint path — source to sink — reading actual code at each hop. Interprocedural traces must follow function calls across file boundaries.

Covers: SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, XSS, SSRF, SSTI, XXE, deserialization, open redirect.

---

### Phase 2: Input validation analysis

Read `sub-skills/input-validator.md`. For every entry point identified in Phase 0:
- Verify validation is present and appropriate for the sink context
- Check for allowlist vs blocklist approach
- Test regex anchoring, type juggling bypasses, encoding bypasses
- Check second-order validation gaps

---

### Phase 3: Business logic and control flow analysis

Read `sub-skills/business-logic-analyzer.md` and `sub-skills/application-vuln-reviewer.md`. Analyze:
- Authentication and authorization decision points
- Workflow state machines (can steps be skipped or reversed?)
- Price/quantity/permission manipulation opportunities
- Race conditions and TOCTOU patterns
- Privilege escalation paths through indirect logic
- Account recovery, CSRF, rate limiting, upload/download, cache leakage, and session lifecycle gaps

---

### Phase 4: API security analysis

Read `sub-skills/api-security-reviewer.md`. For every REST, GraphQL, or RPC endpoint:
- Check for IDOR/BOLA (missing object-level authorization)
- Check for mass assignment in request body → model binding
- Check for excessive data exposure in responses
- Check rate limiting, authentication enforcement
- GraphQL: introspection, depth limits, batch query abuse

If the system has multiple services, tenants, workers, plugins, or cloud resources, also read `sub-skills/architecture-security-reviewer.md` and verify authorization, tenant scoping, and trust-boundary enforcement across the full request/job path.

---

### Phase 5: Authentication and authorization review

Read `sub-skills/auth-reviewer.md`. Examine:
- Authentication mechanisms and bypass paths
- Session management, fixation, expiry
- JWT/token construction and validation
- Authorization middleware — is it applied consistently?
- Privilege escalation and horizontal access control

---

### Phase 6: Cryptography and secrets review

Read `sub-skills/crypto-reviewer.md` and `sub-skills/secret-detector.md`.

Run entropy-based secret scanning:
```bash
python3 scripts/secrets.py --path <target>
```

Analyze:
- Algorithm selection (MD5/SHA1 for security, ECB mode, DES/RC4)
- Key sizes and generation
- Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens
- IV/nonce reuse, predictable keys
- Certificate validation bypasses

---

### Phase 7: Configuration and infrastructure security

Read `sub-skills/config-security-reviewer.md`, `sub-skills/iac-security-reviewer.md`, and `sub-skills/infrastructure-security-reviewer.md`.

Check:
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CORS)
- Debug mode, verbose errors, stack traces in production
- TLS/SSL configuration
- Dockerfile, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform configs
- Cloud IAM policies, public storage buckets, open security groups
- Runtime platform posture, CI/CD deployment trust, KMS/secrets policy, audit logging, public snapshots/backups

---

### Phase 8: Memory safety (C/C++/Rust only)

Read `sub-skills/memory-safety-analyzer.md` when the codebase includes C, C++, or unsafe Rust.

Covers: buffer overflows, use-after-free, format string vulnerabilities, integer overflows in allocation sizes, null pointer dereferences.

---

### Phase 8A: React and Go framework-specific review

When React/Next.js/TSX is present, read `sub-skills/react-security-reviewer.md` and verify client-side DOM XSS, open redirects, browser token storage, postMessage origin checks, hydration data leaks, and client-only authorization.

When Go is present, read `sub-skills/go-security-reviewer.md` and verify request body binding, SQL construction, command execution, SSRF, file access, template use, HTTP server timeouts, CORS, body limits, and concurrency races.

---

### Phase 9: Error handling and information disclosure

Read `sub-skills/error-handling-reviewer.md`. Check:
- Stack traces and exception details leaked to clients
- Verbose SQL errors, file path disclosure
- Enumeration through differential error messages
- Logging of sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)

---

### Phase 10: Dependency audit

```bash
python3 scripts/dependency.py --path <target>
```

Read `sub-skills/dependency-auditor.md` to assess exploitability of flagged packages. Check all manifest types: `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `go.mod`, `Gemfile`, `composer.json`, `Cargo.toml`.

---

### Phase 11: False positive elimination

Read `sub-skills/false-positive-filter.md`. Apply three-pass protocol to **every** candidate:
1. Pass 1 — Source reachability: is the input genuinely user-controlled?
2. Pass 2 — Path completeness: does the taint path hold end-to-end?
3. Pass 3 — Exploitability: can an attacker realistically trigger this?

Only `confirmed` and `likely` findings survive to the report.

---

### Phase 12: Classification and scoring

Read `sub-skills/vuln-classifier.md`. For every surviving finding assign:
- CWE identifier
- OWASP Top 10 / OWASP API Top 10 category
- CVSS v3.1 base score and vector string
- Severity: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `informational`

Update the database:
```bash
python3 scripts/scan.py --update-findings workspace/confirmed_findings.json
```

---

### Phase 13: Report generation

Read `sub-skills/report-generator.md`, then generate all formats:

```bash
python3 scripts/report.py --format markdown --min-severity medium
python3 scripts/report.py --format sarif
python3 scripts/report.py --format json
```

**Save findings to `Vulnscan_results.md` in the scanned project directory.** Copy the Markdown report output there so the results are co-located with the codebase:

```bash
cp workspace/reports/report_*.md <target_path>/Vulnscan_results.md
```

If `workspace/reports/` does not contain the file, write the Markdown report content directly to `<target_path>/Vulnscan_results.md`. This file is the primary human-readable deliverable and must always be created at the end of a full scan.

---
