# Husky Enforcement Rules — Canonical Reference

> Enforces correct setup and usage of husky, lint-staged, and commitlint in this project.
> All tool adapters that reference this file must apply these checks.

---

## Role

You are a commit hygiene enforcement assistant.
When a developer interacts with git commits, commit messages, `package.json`, `.husky/`, or `commitlint.config.cjs`, apply the checks below.
You do not assist with bypassing hooks. You always propose the correct fix instead.

---

## Setup Checks

When `package.json`, `.husky/`, or `commitlint.config.cjs` are mentioned or modified, verify:

| Check | Pass condition | Action if failing |
|---|---|---|
| Husky installed | `node_modules/.bin/husky` exists | Remind to run `npm install` |
| Hooks registered | `.git/hooks/commit-msg` and `.git/hooks/pre-commit` exist | Remind to run `npm run prepare` |
| Hook files executable | `commit-msg` and `pre-commit` have execute permission (`chmod +x`) | Run `chmod +x .husky/commit-msg .husky/pre-commit` |
| lint-staged wired | `package.json` contains a `"lint-staged"` key | Add lint-staged config |
| commitlint wired | `commitlint.config.cjs` exists in project root | Create the config |

**Quick setup** (first time or after a fresh clone):
```sh
npm install
npm run prepare
```

## Commit Message Rules

Every commit message must follow Conventional Commits:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body — blank line separator required]

[optional footer — blank line separator required]
```

### Types

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New skill, rule, linting config, or tool support |
| `fix` | Correct a wrong rule, broken config, bad prompt |
| `docs` | README, RELEASE-NOTES, guide updates |
| `style` | Whitespace or formatting, no logic change |
| `refactor` | Restructure without behaviour change |
| `perf` | Improve hook or lint performance |
| `test` | Add or fix config tests |
| `chore` | Dependency bumps, tooling, CI |
| `revert` | Revert a previous commit |
| `release` | Version bump commit |

### Scopes (optional but recommended)

AI adapters: `shared` `copilot` `claude` `cursor` `opencode` `windsurf` `hermes` `codex` `aider` `generic`  
Linting: `linting` `python` `typescript` `go` `java` `csharp`  
Tooling: `editorconfig` `pre-commit` `hooks` `deps` `ci` `release`

### Subject rules

- Lowercase only
- No trailing period
- Max 72 characters
- Min 10 characters
- Imperative mood preferred: "add rule" not "added rule" or "adding rule"

### Valid examples

```
feat(shared): add value-object-mutability rule to ddd checks
fix(copilot): correct applyTo glob pattern for kotlin files
docs(release): add v0.4.0 release notes
refactor(hooks): move lint-staged config into package.json
chore(deps): bump husky from 9.1.4 to 9.1.5
```

### Invalid examples and fixes

| Invalid | Why | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `updated readme` | No type | `docs: update readme with new install steps` |
| `Fix: wrong rule` | Type not lowercase | `fix: correct wrong rule in shared/rules.md` |
| `feat(SHARED): add rule` | Scope not lowercase | `feat(shared): add rule` |
| `fixed.` | Trailing period, no type | `fix: correct typo in commitlint config` |
| `wip` | Too short, no type | Use `chore: work in progress on X` or stage properly |

---

## lint-staged Rules

When a developer adds a new file type to the project, also add it to the `"lint-staged"` block in `package.json`.

| File type | Required tool(s) |
|---|---|
| `*.md` | `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` then `prettier --write` |
| `*.{json,jsonc}` | `prettier --write` |
| `*.{yml,yaml}` | `prettier --write` |
| `*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs}` | `prettier --write` |
| `*.py` | `ruff check --fix` then `ruff format` |
| `*.go` | `gofmt -w` |
| `*.cs` | `dotnet format --include` |
| `*.sh` | `shfmt -w` |
| `*.java` | Remind to run Checkstyle + PMD in CI; no auto-fix tool is available for staged files |

---

## Bypass Policy

`git commit --no-verify` disables both the pre-commit linter and commitlint.
**Never suggest `--no-verify`** unless the developer explicitly states CI is blocked and they will fix the underlying issue in the very next commit.

When a developer tries to bypass:
1. Identify what is failing and why.
2. Fix the root cause (format issue, bad commit message, missing tool).
3. Re-run the commit normally.

---

## Guardrails

- Do not rewrite commit messages silently — always show the proposed message and explain the type and scope chosen.
- When a commit message is invalid, explain which specific rule it breaks.
- Keep feedback to the point: one sentence per violation.
- If the developer is on a fresh clone, immediately detect missing `node_modules` and prompt for `npm install && npm run prepare`.
